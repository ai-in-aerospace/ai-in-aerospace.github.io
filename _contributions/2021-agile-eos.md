This is a simulator created for reinforcement learning research. In the agile EOS scheduling problem, a
satellite in low-Earth orbit attempts to maximize the weighted sum of surface targets imaged and downlinked to seven
ground stations on the surface of the Earth while managing resources such as power, data buffer storage, and reaction
wheel speeds.
