This is a simulator created for reinforcement learning research. In the nadir-science EOS scheduling problem, a
satellite in low-Earth orbit attempts to maximize the amount of data downlinked to seven ground stations on the
surface of the Earth while managing resources such as power, data buffer storage, and reaction wheel speeds.
